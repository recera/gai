1. ULTRA THINK
2. Always seek a maximally thorough understanding first. Take your time.

4. As you generate code, be maximally thorough. Ensuring your solutions are complete, thorough, and proper.
5. We will do many new things, be prepared to think of new novel solutions.
6. Take your time, we are never in a rush. You can spend a many hours on a given task.

9. When we come across bugs, don't witch hunt for a solution. Even if you think you've found it, you are likely still lacking useful information. Continue to spend 14 hours digging through the code to build a more thorough and complete understanding.
10. This will be a production open source product. Our code needs to be of the highest quality with proper test coverage.
11. Never take short cuts with tests. Never simplfy source code to pass a test. Always consider what the proper solution is and work towards that.
